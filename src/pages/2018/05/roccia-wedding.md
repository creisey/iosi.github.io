One of my sisters, Jessica, is getting married in a couple of days. She started building a website for herself on The Knot, but didn't want something so generic. I told her I could help her out and build a one-page website that she could send to her family and friends.

The website uses a "dusty rose" color that she was already using with fade-in animations. The website was designed to not be a lot, so everyone could focus on the story with her soon to be husband, Chris, and their engagement photos. The website also provides the needed information for her out-of-town wedding guests that she didn't want to include in the envelope with her beautiful wedding invitations.

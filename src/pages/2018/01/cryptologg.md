CryptoLogg was an idea I had to only show the price change of cryptocurrencies since the last time they were checked. The personal project is a single page application built in React, before later switching to Preact, using the CryptoCompare API and localStorage.

CryptoLogg has received recognition from <a href="https://onepagelove.com/cryptologg" target="_blank">One Page Love</a> and was the #4 Product of the Day on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/cryptologg" target="_blank">Product Hunt</a>.
